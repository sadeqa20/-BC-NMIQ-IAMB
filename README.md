The proposed a new model, called Best Clustering Normalized Mutual Information Quantile (BC-NMIQ), to rank the best features using the square root threshold. Finally, the proposed BC-NMIQ was improved with the optimal set of features selected automatically using the Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB) feature selection method. The measurement criteria were applied to BC-NMIQ-IAMB as the main proposed method and also to BC-NMIQ as subsidiary proposed method. In fact, the hybrid BC-NMIQ-IAMB is the combination of a proposed filter method (BC-NMIQ) and the existing automatic filter feature selection approach (IAMB).
